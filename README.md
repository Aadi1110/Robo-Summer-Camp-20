# Summer Camp, 2020  
## On Robot Control and simulation based on PyBullet

   The current edition of the summer camp conducted by the Robotics Club, IIT (BHU)-2020 ,aims at providing a structured approach towards robot development and control based on the simulation tool PyBullet.This repository will be the primary source of code and content related to the camp.The repositry will be updated part wise with subfolders which has topic wise theory and problem statements/tasks.
   
The file structure of a given part in this repo is as follows:

  * PART - I 
      * SUB PART 1
         * Content and links
         * Task to solve
         * Starter code
      * SUB PART 2
      
      so on ..

   Thus, you are expected to go through all the sub parts,read the content and solve all the tasks inorder to complete the respective part.The course is divided into 4 such parts and a team project.The sucessive parts will be updates along durng the course of the camp.
   
  This camp is open to all IIT (BHU) students and the entire mangement and non-technical queries are addresed using a local social group(Whatsapp).

  A more detailed overview of the cummer camp structure is provided in this - [pdf](https://github.com/NiranthS/Pybullet-Camp-Part1/blob/master/Camp_Overview.pdf).
