# Subpart 2

Given that pybullet is running, its time to define or rather redefine what a robot is !!!

Any robot is constructed by a combination of rigid bodies and joints.These rigid bodies are called Links.These links are inter related by means of different types of joints.

**Base:**
	As the name suggests , this is the primary link of the bot to which all the other links are joined.(Link 1 in the picture)

**Parent and Child links:**
          A link is named as a parent link with respect to a joint.For instance  wrt the joint 2 ,Link 1 is the parent and Link 3 is a child.

**Joints:**
	Any form of motion causing inter linkages are called as Joints.Joints are broadly classified into 3 types.
1. Revolute
2. Prismatic
3. Universal

**Note:** In simulations we don't consider the electronic systems required for the control of the robots rather we program a joint level controllers (will be explained in future parts).

## Unified Robotic Description Format (URDF)

   The Unified Robotic Description Format (URDF) is an XML file format native to ROS that describes the robot properties like geometry,mass,inertia,collision model,etc in the form of tags which is cross platform and easy to work with.Thus the same urdf of a given robot can be used across various simulation tools.

**URDF can be generated by two ways:**
1. By compiling the model  file in ROS(Robot Operating System).
2. By directly exporting the URDF of a 3D cad model.(Only Solidworks supports it)

Since,in this camp we try exploring a beginner friendly approach towards robot simulation we don't prefer getting into ROS and also the camp aims to concentrate more on addressing the control related problems and not the fabrication of the robot using CAD softwares.Hence,the required URDF files will be provided along with the tasks and creation of these files is not required for now.

**Note:** Though you can't create these files, you are always free to edit a given URDF file using a simple test editor (like notepad).A more in depth understanding is provided here(http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials).

## Task for the part:
To create a the urdf file for a simpile robot structure depicted below:

</p>
This is called a **_2R Planar robot arm_**, as it has **2 Revoute Joints** that inter connects a base and 2 links.

**Note:**
1. The task requires you to only build a **Visual** robot - meaning its enough if the robot has visual and geometry tags  alone (No need for Mass,cCollision,Inertia and other physical properties though they will be covered in the upcoming parts.)
2. Dont worry about about visualizing the URDF you have created,as it is covered in the very next sub-part.
3. The links below will be very use full for realizing this task,(skip the ros parts, juzt follow about the tags in urdf)
