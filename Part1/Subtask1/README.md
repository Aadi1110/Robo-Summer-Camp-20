# What is  Simulation?:
Simulation software is based on the process of modeling a real phenomenon with a set of mathematical formulas. It is, essentially, a program that allows the user to observe an operation through simulation without actually performing that operation.Thus, it proves to be a very close proxy to the real world i.e. a mathematical model of the real world processes. The simulation plays  a very important role in robotics. Different tools are used for the analysis of kinematics(does not include the cause of motion) , dynamics(includes the cause of motion) of robotic manipulators, for off-line programming, to design different control algorithms, to design mechanical structure of robots, to design robotic cells and production lines, etc.
# Simulation Vs Emulation:
Two of the terms that are often misused are simulation and emulation.
Simulation is when you are replicating, by the means of software, the general behaviour of a system starting from a conceptual model.
Eg :- Softwares used by Space agencies to model the unknown planet      conditions.
Emulation is when you are replicating, in a different system, how the original system actually internally works considering each function and their relations.
Eg:-Android emulators for windows like Bluestacks,Andy,etc
Thus, we as robotic technicians need a mathematical model of the world/environments and the physics that governs them , for us experimenting out our robots.Hence,simulation is what we do.
