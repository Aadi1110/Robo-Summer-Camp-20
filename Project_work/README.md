This camp requires the submission of project work along with the assignments of the first three parts. We expect you to work in a team of 3-4 members and submit a report and the code of the same. The instructions are as below.

## Teame Mates:

</p>

_FYI, it's not in school any more :-)._

We leave the selection of the team members to you and could be either a team of **3 or 4** and unlike the assignments **working alone is not allowed and you are expected to only work as a team**. Feel free to branch out to fellow campmates, randomize your teammates and pick a team based on your **individual strengths and weaknesses**. We are listing the skill demands for this project, that we feel will make a healthy team. It's just a suggestion though.

1. The writers:-People who can bring out a novel idea, formulate a problem, analyze its technical feasibility and present it at its best

2. The makers:-People who are hardcore implementors good at rapid prototyping and document the code well.

3. The Alpha:-People who carry the vision of the problem statement in hand and make sure the team is on the right track. They generally need to hold carry on the perspective of both the writer and makers and function as one among them as well.

**Feel free to interact well in the Robot Summer Camp WhatsApp group, open up to new people, analyze well and pick your teams wisely.**

## Problem Statement:

<div align="center">
  
  _"You_
  
  _are_
  
  _your problem_
  
  _you_
  
  _are_ 
  
  _your Solution"_
  
 </div>
  
It's not that we are lazy to make a PS, but would rather expect to work on problems that you feel needs to be solved in robotics. You are open to select **a problem/idea and implement a working solution/prototype in simulation to the same in pybullet**. The only restriction however is that it should **strictly be in the domain of robotics**. You are free to use any robots either built-in or custom designed. Some available robots and some example ideas are listed below.

**Available Built-in robot urdf's in Pybullet:"**

1. "husky/husky.urdf" , a wheeled robotics platform
2. "quadruped/minitaur.urdf", a four legged quadraped robot from Ghost robotics
3. "mini_cheetah/mini_cheetah.urdf", a four legged quadraped robot from MIT
4. "humanoid/humanoid.urdf", a 34 dof humanoid model
5. "biped/biped2d_pybullet.urdf", a biped robot that could traverse in constrined 2d space
6. "bicycle/bike.urdf",its a dumb bicycle
7. "racecar/racecar.urdf", a model race car



You can make them **walk, run, jump, dance, follow a track, image processing based control, control through manual control, puppet rig, a combination of the concepts taught in the camp itself, control systems, sensor-based automation, IK and FK for any of the robots, Imitation learning, ML-based robotics, anything else and etc**. Your creativity is your limit.

## What to submit:

We expect a **2-3 page report with the mentioned topics and the codebase of your project**. A model format of the report is added for your reference.[project_report_format.pdf](https://github.com/NiranthS/Robo-Summer-Camp-20/blob/master/Project_work/project_report_format.pdf)

### In report:

**Topics to be present:**

1. **Abstract**, _a brief write up describing work_.

2. **Problem Addressed**, _2-3 line write of the PS you selected_

3. **Your approach**,_4-5 lines abt the novelty and reasons behind opting such an approach_

4. **Key Concepts used**, _list the technical concepts used_.

5. **Conclusion**, _how much were you able to succeed in your attempt, and briefly describe your limitations and future work if any._

6. **References and Acknowledgements**

**Note:**

1. All the above-mentioned topics must be present though you are free to add more if you need it.

2. Strictly, stick on to the **format shared and the page limit**

3. The report should present in **pdf format** and is to be submitted along with the code-base.

### In Code-base:

1. You are expected to submit a link to the **code and a small video clip showing the features of your project.**

3. You can either make a **Github repository** for the project or simply upload in a **drive folder** and submit the corresponding link.

## Evaluation:

1. Your project will be evaluated based on the novelty, report documentation quality, and efforts in implementation.

2. We are slightly biased towards the report and will evaluate with a weight of **65%** for the report and **35%** for the actual code.

3. We are adopting a **ternary evaluation system**, and will be graded as follows and marked according to the formula **(3^n)** where the n values are as follows.
   
   1. **Outstanding**,n=3
   2. **Great**,n=2
   3. **Sorry we are out of grades**,n = -inf
   
4. The team score will be **as such added to your individual scores and will be accounted for top 3 positions of the camp, but just upon submitting the project you are entitled to receive a certificate of completion irrespective of your grades**.

5. Feel free to clarify any doubts before the actual start of your project.
